problem :


User Query -> Docs From VectorDB using that Query -> Prompt which goes like

"Answer the following query using only the docs given:
Query: User Query

Doc 1:
aasasdsasa

Doc 2:
asdasdada

Doc 3:
paisdjaosid

....
....
...." (You dont tell the llm the pdf names. Only you keep a map of the pdf names associated with each doc number.

-> Pydantic Parser with two keys: answer(answer to the question), citations: List[int] Document IDs
-> Map the doc ids back to doc names and give the answer with doc names


Architecture design :


## 1. User Provides Prompt :
   :types :-
   - Specify Generally :
        - Generalized Question - entirely from DB
            - Args : {
            question : str
            }

        - Document Specific / Page Number Specific Question
            - Specific Document from DB -> (summarize / provide insights from Document(s) / specific Page(s)

        ### attributed to be taken from
        - DB Query -> Formats query for similarity search ## do few shot prompting for rephrasing texts
        - LLM Query -> Formats query for LLM ## take meta data information out and formats only query needed

        ## take from LLM / From Retrieval Chain
        - Citations -> takes citation details from metadata of documents retrieved
            - source
            - page

        - Top_k -> document retrieval limit ## if given by user need to extract the same


   ### Optional paramters of PDF
